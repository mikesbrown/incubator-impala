  <title>Table and Column Statistics</title>
  

  <conbody>

    <p>
      Impala can do better optimization for complex or multi-table queries when it has access to statistics about
      the volume of data and how the values are distributed. Impala uses this information to help parallelize and
      distribute the work for a query. For example, optimizing join queries requires a way of determining if one
      table is <q>bigger</q> than another, which is a function of the number of rows and the average row size
      for each table. The following sections describe the categories of statistics Impala can work
      with, and how to produce them and keep them up to date.
