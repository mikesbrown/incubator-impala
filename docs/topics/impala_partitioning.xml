      By default, all the data files for a table are located in a single directory. Partitioning is a technique for
      physically dividing the data during loading, based on values from one or more columns, to speed up queries
      that test those columns. For example, with a <codeph>school_records</codeph> table partitioned on a
      <codeph>year</codeph> column, there is a separate data directory for each different year value, and all the
      data for that year is stored in a data file in that directory. A query that includes a <codeph>WHERE</codeph>
      condition such as <codeph>YEAR=1966</codeph>, <codeph>YEAR IN (1989,1999)</codeph>, or <codeph>YEAR BETWEEN
      1984 AND 1989</codeph> can examine only the data files from the appropriate directory or directories, greatly
      reducing the amount of data to read and test.
