  <title>Hive SQL Syntax for Use with Sentry</title>
  
  <conbody>
    <p id="intro">Sentry permissions can be configured through Grant and Revoke statements
      issued either interactively or programmatically through the HiveServer2
      SQL command line interface, Beeline (documentation available <xref
        href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beeline%E2%80%93NewCommandLineShell"
        format="html" scope="external">here</xref>). The syntax described below
      is very similar to the <codeph>GRANT/REVOKE</codeph> commands available in
      well-established relational database systems.<note type="important">
        <ul id="ul_u1d_l5t_4r">
          <li>When Sentry is enabled, you must use Beeline to execute Hive
            queries. Hive CLI is not supported with Sentry and must be
            disabled.</li>
          <li>There are some differences in syntax between Hive and the
            corresponding Impala SQL statements. For the Impala syntax, see
              <xref href="impala_langref_sql.xml#langref_sql">SQL
              Statements</xref>.</li>
        </ul>
