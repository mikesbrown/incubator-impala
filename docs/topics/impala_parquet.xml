      Impala helps you to create, manage, and query Parquet tables. Parquet is a column-oriented binary file format
      intended to be highly efficient for the types of large-scale queries that Impala is best at. Parquet is
      especially good for queries scanning particular columns within a table, for example to query <q>wide</q>
      tables with many columns, or to perform aggregation operations such as <codeph>SUM()</codeph> and
      <codeph>AVG()</codeph> that need to process most or all of the values from a column. Each data file contains
      the values for a set of rows (the <q>row group</q>). Within a data file, the values from each column are
      organized so that they are all adjacent, enabling good compression for the values from that column. Queries
      against a Parquet table can retrieve and analyze these values from any column quickly and with minimal I/O.
