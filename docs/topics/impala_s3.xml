      You can use Impala to query data residing on the Amazon S3 filesystem. This capability allows convenient
      access to a storage system that is remotely managed, accessible from anywhere, and integrated with various
      cloud-based services. Impala can query files in any supported file format from S3. The S3 storage location
      can be for an entire table, or individual partitions in a partitioned table.
