  <title>Using Impala to Query Kudu Tables</title>

      You can use Impala to query Kudu tables. This capability allows convenient access to a storage system that is
      tuned for different kinds of workloads than the default with Impala. The default Impala tables use data files
      stored on HDFS, which are ideal for bulk loads and queries using full-table scans. In contrast, Kudu can do
      efficient queries for data organized either in data warehouse style (with full table scans) or for OLTP-style
      workloads (with key-based lookups for single rows or small ranges of values).
