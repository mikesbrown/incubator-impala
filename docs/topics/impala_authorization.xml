  <title>Enabling Sentry Authorization for Impala</title>
  

  <conbody id="sentry">

    <p>
      Authorization determines which users are allowed to access which resources, and what operations they are
      allowed to perform. In Impala 1.1 and higher, you use the Sentry open source project for authorization.
      Sentry adds a fine-grained authorization framework for Hadoop. By default (when authorization is not
      enabled), Impala does all read and write operations with the privileges of the <codeph>impala</codeph> user,
      which is suitable for a development/test environment but not for a secure production environment. When
      authorization is enabled, Impala uses the OS user ID of the user who runs <cmdname>impala-shell</cmdname> or
      other client program, and associates various privileges with each user.
