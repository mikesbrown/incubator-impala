      You can use Impala to query HBase tables. This capability allows convenient access to a storage system that
      is tuned for different kinds of workloads than the default with Impala. The default Impala tables use data
      files stored on HDFS, which are ideal for bulk loads and queries using full-table scans. In contrast, HBase
      can do efficient queries for data organized for OLTP-style workloads, with lookups of individual rows or
      ranges of values.
