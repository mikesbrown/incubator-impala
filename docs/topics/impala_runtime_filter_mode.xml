    </p>

    <p>
      The <codeph>RUNTIME_FILTER_MODE</codeph> query option
      adjusts the settings for the runtime filtering feature.
      It turns this feature on and off, and controls how
      extensively the filters are transmitted between hosts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Type:</b> numeric (0, 1, 2)
      or corresponding mnemonic strings (<codeph>OFF</codeph>, <codeph>LOCAL</codeph>, <codeph>GLOBAL</codeph>).
    </p>

    <p rev="2.6.0 CDH-41184">
      <b>Default:</b> 2 (equivalent to <codeph>GLOBAL</codeph>); formerly was 1 / <codeph>LOCAL</codeph>, in CDH 5.7 / Impala 2.5
    </p>

    <p rev="2.6.0 CDH-41184">
      In CDH 5.8 / Impala 2.6 and higher, the default is <codeph>GLOBAL</codeph>.
      This setting is recommended for a wide variety of workloads, to provide best
      performance with <q>out of the box</q> settings.
    </p>

    <p rev="2.6.0 CDH-41184">
      The lowest setting of <codeph>LOCAL</codeph> does a similar level of optimization
      (such as partition pruning) as in earlier Impala releases.
      This setting was the default in CDH 5.7 / Impala 2.5,
      to allow for a period of post-upgrade testing for existing workloads.
      This setting is suitable for workloads with non-performance-critical queries,
      or if the coordinator node is under heavy CPU or memory pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might change the setting to <codeph>OFF</codeph> if your workload contains
      many queries involving partitioned tables or joins that do not experience a performance
      increase from the runtime filters feature. If the overhead of producing the runtime filters
      outweighs the performance benefit for queries, you can turn the feature off entirely.
