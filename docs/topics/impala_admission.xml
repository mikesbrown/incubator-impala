  <title>Admission Control and Query Queuing</title>
  

  <conbody>

    <p id="admission_control_intro">
      Admission control is an Impala feature that imposes limits on concurrent SQL queries, to avoid resource usage
      spikes and out-of-memory conditions on busy CDH clusters.
      It is a form of <q>throttling</q>.
      New queries are accepted and executed until
      certain conditions are met, such as too many queries or too much
      total memory used across the cluster.
      When one of these thresholds is reached,
      incoming queries wait to begin execution. These queries are
      queued and are admitted (that is, begin executing) when the resources become available.
