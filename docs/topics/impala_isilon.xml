      You can use Impala to query data files that reside on EMC Isilon storage devices, rather than in HDFS.
      This capability allows convenient query access to a storage system where you might already be
      managing large volumes of data. The combination of the Impala query engine and Isilon storage is
      certified on CDH 5.4.4 or higher.
