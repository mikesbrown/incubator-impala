      Impala supports several familiar file formats used in Apache Hadoop. Impala can load and query data files
      produced by other Hadoop components such as Pig or MapReduce, and data files produced by Impala can be used
      by other components also. The following sections discuss the procedures, limitations, and performance
      considerations for using each file format with Impala.
