    <p>
      Impala queries progress through a series of stages from the time they are initiated to the time
      they are completed. A query can also be cancelled before it is entirely finished, either
      because of an explicit cancellation, or because of a timeout, out-of-memory, or other error condition.
      Understanding the query lifecycle can help you manage the throughput and resource usage of Impala
      queries, especially in a high-concurrency or multi-workload environment.
