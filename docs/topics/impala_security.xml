    <p>
      Impala includes a fine-grained authorization framework for Hadoop, based on the Sentry
      open source project. Sentry authorization was added in Impala 1.1.0. Together with the Kerberos authentication
      framework, Sentry takes Hadoop security to a new level needed for the requirements of highly regulated industries
      such as healthcare, financial services, and government. Impala also includes
      an auditing capability; Impala generates the audit data, the Cloudera Navigator product consolidates
      the audit data from all nodes in the cluster, and Cloudera Manager lets you filter, visualize, and produce
      reports. The auditing feature was added in Impala 1.1.1.
