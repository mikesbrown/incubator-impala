    <p>
      This section explains how the size of your cluster and the volume of data influences SQL performance and
      schema design for Impala tables. Typically, adding more cluster capacity reduces problems due to memory
      limits or disk throughput. On the other hand, larger clusters are more likely to have other kinds of
      scalability issues, such as a single slow node that causes performance problems for queries.
