      Third-party products can be designed to integrate with Impala using ODBC. For the best experience, ensure any
      third-party product you intend to use is supported. Verifying support includes checking that the versions of
      Impala, ODBC, the operating system, and the third-party product have all been approved for use together.
      Before configuring your systems to use ODBC, download a connector.
      You may need to sign in and accept license agreements before accessing the pages required for downloading
      ODBC connectors.
