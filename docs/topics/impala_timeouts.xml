    <p>
      Depending on how busy your CDH cluster is, you might increase or decrease various timeout values.
      Increase timeouts if Impala is cancelling operations prematurely, when the system is
      responding slower than usual but the operations are still successful if given extra time.
      Decrease timeouts if operations are idle or hanging for long periods, and the
      idle or hung operations are consuming resources and reducing concurrency.
