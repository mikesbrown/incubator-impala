  <title>Performance Considerations for Join Queries</title>

    <p>
      Queries involving join operations often require more tuning than queries that refer to only one table. The
      maximum size of the result set from a join query is the product of the number of rows in all the joined
      tables. When joining several tables with millions or billions of rows, any missed opportunity to filter the
      result set, or other inefficiency in the query, could lead to an operation that does not finish in a
      practical time and has to be cancelled.
