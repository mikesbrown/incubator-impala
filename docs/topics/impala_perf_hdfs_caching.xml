    <p>
      HDFS caching provides performance and scalability benefits in production environments where Impala queries
      and other Hadoop jobs operate on quantities of data much larger than the physical RAM on the data nodes,
      making it impractical to rely on the Linux OS cache, which only keeps the most recently used data in memory.
      Data read from the HDFS cache avoids the overhead of checksumming and memory-to-memory copying involved when
      using data from the Linux OS cache.
