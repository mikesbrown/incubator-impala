      Impala supports the standard JDBC interface, allowing access from commercial Business Intelligence tools and
      custom software written in Java or other programming languages. The JDBC driver allows you to access Impala
      from a Java program that you write, or a Business Intelligence or similar tool that uses JDBC to communicate
      with various database products.
